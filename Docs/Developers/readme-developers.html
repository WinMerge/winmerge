<h3><a name="Compiling">Compiling</a></h3>

<p>Compiling sources is usually the first thing you want to do. Source packages for
different versions are available from SourceForge.net.</p>

<h3>Environment</h3>
<h4>Supported Compilers</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Visual Studio 2003.Net + Service Pack 1 (used for releases)</li>
  <li>Visual Studio 6 + Service Pack 6</li>
  <li>Visual Studio 2005 (occasional checks for compiling) (Service Pack 1 recommended)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that WinMerge uses MFC heavily. So free (Express) editions of Visual Studio cannot
compile WinMerge, unless you have MFC installed separately.</p>

<h4>Libraries</h4>
<p>WinMerge executable depends on Expat XML parser and SCEW wrapper libraries. Both are in
the source tree, but need to be compiled before compiling WinMerge executable.</p>

<h4>Additional requirements (out of source tree)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>HTML Help Workshop (either stand-alone or from Platform SDK)<br>
    Download it from :<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp">
    HTMLHelp download</a>.</li>
  <li>Platform SDK - be sure to use version that works with your version of Visual Studio:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>VC6</strong>: Platform SDK February 2003 - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm">
        Download and install</a></li>
      <li><strong>VS2003.Net and later</strong>: Platform SDK Windows 2003 SP1 -
       <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0BAF2B35-C656-4969-ACE8-E4C0C0716ADB">
       Download and install</a></li>
    </ul>
    Visual Studio 2003.Net and later come with Platform SDK but you may still want more recent version...</li>
  <li>Installer needs own tools, documented in <a href="readme-InnoSetup.html">readme-InnoSetup.html</a></li>
  <li>Manual needs Docbook tools, documented in <a href="readme-manual.html">readme-manual.html</a></li>
</ul>

<h5>Platform SDK components</h5>
<p>With Feb 2003 Platform SDK (and VC6) following components are needed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Core SDK - obviously..</li>
  <li>MDAC SDK - for some ODBC etc headers needed by other PSDK headers..</li>
  <li>Internet Devlopment SDK - for IE/Shell headers</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically same components are needed for Windows 2003 SP1 PSDK, but with a different name:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Windows Core SDK - obviously..</li>
  <li>Microsoft Data Access Services (MDAC) SDK - for some ODBC etc headers needed by other PSDK headers..</li>
  <li>Microsoft Web Workshop (IE) SDK - for IE/Shell headers</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">If you installed PSDK separately, don't forget to add the PSDK paths to Visual
Studio's <em>Include</em> and <em>Library</em> directories. The easiest way is to use the
"<em>Visual Studio Registration\Register PSDK directories with Visual Studio</em>" item from
the "<em>Platform SDK</em>" start menu folder.</p>

<h4>buildall.bat</h4>
<p>There is a <code>buildall.bat</code> in the root folder of source tree. This batch file invokes
<code>devenv.exe</code> to build (almost) all projects in WinMerge tree. However, it has
a couple
of restrictions:
<ul>
  <li>It cannot convert project files from VC6 format to newer formats. This must be done first
      by opening every project to Visual Studio.</li>
  <li>It cannot build 64-bit shell extension</li>
</ul></p>

<p>To use <code>buildall.bat</code>:
<ul>
  <li>Open Visual Studio Command Prompt (or run <code>vcvars32.bat</code> from Command Prompt).</li>
  <li>Go to root folder of WinMerge folder structure.</li>
  <li>Run the batch file.</li>
</ul></p>

<h4>Project files</h4>
<p>Project file for WinMerge executable (in <code>/Src</code>) and other projects like
ShellExtension (in <code>/ShellExtension</code>) have their own project files. There is no one
single project/workspace file to compile all projects.<p>

<p>The Visual Studio project file for MSVC6 comes with the WinMerge sources. Newer versions of
Visual Studio can open that file too, they just ask if one wants to convert to
the new version.
The reason we don't ship project files for all Visual Studio versions is we have no resources
to keep all versions up to date. People can't test all versions themselves, and easily forget
to update at least one file. So we easily end up in a situation where there is no properly
working project file at all...</p>

<p>After opening the project file you need to add the HTML Help Workshop path as additional include-
and library-path.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> There might be problems compiling/debugging with Visual Studio 2003 when using
HTML Help WorkShop from the Platform SDK in Visual Studio directory. Download and
install HTML Workshop as stand-alone and include headers and libraries from standalone
directory. The probable cause is that including files from Platform SDK directories breaks
things.</p>

<p><b>NOTE2:</b> WinMerge building uses couple of helper batch files (<code>Src/PreLink.bat</code>
 and <code>Src/PostBuild.bat</code>) run from project file. Visual Studio may add additional
 quotation marks to these rules when converting for new version, which makes builds to fail.
 So check that rules to call those batch files are like:</p>
 
 <code>PreLink.bat $(IntDir) $(TargetPath)</code>
 
 <p>without additional quotation marks, like:</p>
 
 <code>PreLink.bat "$(IntDir)" "$(TargetPath)"</code>

<h4>Compiling expat</h4>
<p>expat is in <code>/Externals/expat</code> folder in source tree. To compile expat:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Visual Studio workspace <code>/Externals/expat/expat.dsw</code>. If you are
    using Visual Studio 2003.Net or later you need to convert the file to the new format when
    Visual Studio opens the file.</li>
  <li>Select from Visual Studio menu Build / Batch Build</li>
  <li>Select either debug or release targets.</li>
  <li>Select Rebuild All</li>
 </ul>

<p>After build finishes, selected (debug or release) lib and dll files are in
<code>/Build/expat</code>. WinMerge executable's project file picks them from there.</p>

<h4>Compiling scew</h4>
<p>scew is in <code>/Externals/scew</code> folder in source tree. To compile scew:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Visual Studio project file <code>/Externals/scew/win32/scew.dsp</code> If you are
    using Visual Studio 2003.Net or later you need to convert the file to the new format when
    Visual Studio opens the file.</li>
  <li>Select from Visual Studio menu Build / Batch Build</li>
  <li>Make sure all targets are selected</li>
  <li>Select Rebuild All</li>
</ul>

<h4>Compiling PCRE</h4>
<p>PCRE is in <code>/Externals/pcre</code> folder in source tree. To compile PCRE:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Visual Studio workspace file <code>/Externals/pcre/pcre.dsw</code> If you are
    using Visual Studio 2003.Net or later you need to convert the file to the new format when
    Visual Studio opens the file.</li>
  <li>Select from Visual Studio menu Build / Batch Build</li>
  <li>Select <code>config_pcre</code> and <code>pcre</code> projects and build them</li>
  <li>Select Rebuild All</li>
  <li><i>Or</i> you can also compile those two projects individually, first
    <code>config_pcre</code> and then <code>pcre</code> project.
</ul>

<p>After build finishes, lib and dll files are in <code>/Build/pcre</code>. WinMerge
executable's project file picks them from there.</p>

<h4>Compiling WinMerge executable targets</h4>
<p>There are several targets available for compiling different projects. Targets used
for compiling releases are:<br>
<ul>
  <li><code>WinMerge.exe</code> : Release</li>
  <li><code>WinMergeU.exe</code> : UnicodeRelease</li>
  <li><code>ShellExtension.dll</code> : Release MinDependency</li>
  <li><code>ShellExtensionU.dll</code> : Unicode Release MinDependency</li>
  <li>Plugin dlls : Unicode Release MinDependency</li>
</ul>

<h4>Visual Studio 2005</h4>
<p>When the VC6 project file (.dsp) is converted to a Visual Studio 2005 project, it does not
compile correctly as is. The problem is Visual Studio 2005 automatically generates and
embeds a manifest file for the executable. And as the WinMerge resource file includes
a manifest
file there are conflicts.</p>

<p>The easiest way to fix the compile is to disable VS2005 from creating and embedding
the manifest file. From project properties:
<ul>
  <li>disable Linker / Manifest File / Generate Manifest (set to "No")</li>
  <li>disable Manifest Tool / Input and Output/ Embed Manifest (set to "No")
</ul></p>

<h3><a name="Code_changes">Code changes</a></h3>

<p>Please follow these guidelines when submitting changes to WinMerge sources
as patches.</p>

<p class="note">Do not waste yours and our time by submitting large feature
patches before you have made sure the feature is a desired addition to WinMerge. Communicate with
our developers,
either in bug/feature request(rfe) items or preferably in the Developers-forum or Developers-
mailing list.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Post development intentions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you are fixing a bug, put a note in the SourceForge bug report that you're
        fixing it. If there is no SourceForge bug report, create one.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are implementing a new feature, put a note in the SourceForge Feature
        Request item that you're implementing it. If there is no SourceForge Feature
		Request item, create one. Alternatively you can discuss	new features
		in the Developers-forum or Developers-mailing list. Please use this! It is a lot
		less work wasted when we agree about design first.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before you start developing, make sure to capture
    a snapshot of your starting sources (presumably a pristine copy of sources from
    subversion, or of a source zip from a distribution).</p>

    <p><b>DO NOT</b> submit a patch against a year-old version. The latest experimental/beta version
    is at most a few weeks old. Stable releases should only get bug fixes. And even then
    the bugfix
    is usually first applied to development versions. So there should be no reason to submit
    a patch against an old version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Review the sections on <a href="#Coding_conventions">Coding conventions</a>
    and <a href="#Doxygen_comments">Doxygen comments</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Develop your new version.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>Post your changes as a patch, to the SourceForge patch list. Try to give an
    informative patch title of course. Post to any relevant SourceForge bugs
    or RFEs, giving the patch number and title.</p>
    <p>If the bug/rfe item is already assigned to you (or you submitted it), you can
    also attach patch into that item. Remember to add a comment so others notice the
    new attachment.</p>
    <p>The active developers have often been posting entire original and modified
    files rather than traditional diffs, because obviously all developers
    have access to WinMerge to compare original and modified files, and this
    may be viewed as an infinite line context diff :)</p>
    <p><b>HINT:</b> If you have archive support installed in WinMerge you can do a folder
    compare of your original and changed source trees. And then select <code>Zip - Differences</code>
    from context menu and WinMerge creates a zip-file for you. Ready to be posted!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wait for reactions from other developers (and sometimes active users).<br>
    Usually this means one of the active developers approves your patch before
    you commit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a reasonable amount of time has passed, and one of active developers
    has approved the patch, apply the patch to Subversion. (Or ask a
    project member to do so, if you don't have developer access to
    the project.)</p>
    <p>What is a reasonable amount of time? That is somewhat subjective, and
    we need to rely on your expertise as the patch developer, but let us
    suggest waiting a few days for minor patches, and at least a week for
    major patches.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add a note in <code>Src/Changes.txt</code> telling what files you committed,
    and what bug/RFE/patch you solved. This is very important so everybody else
    has a chance to figure out who did what and when.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Note that <code>Src/Changes.txt</code> was split from <code>Src/readme.txt</code> after
2.4.0 release. So <code>Src/readme.txt</code> contains older changelog entries. Also, many
subfolders have their own <code>Changes.txt</code> -file. If the file exists in the folder, it must be
used instead of "global" <code>Src/Changes.txt</code>.

<h3><a name="MakePatchDirs">MakePatchDirs</a></h3>

<p>Perry wrote a small program called
<a href="readme-developers-MakePatchDirs.html">MakePatchDirs</a>, which helps
in his patch process -- read the link for more information.</p>

<h3><a name="Minor_code_changes_and_bug_fixes">Minor code changes and bug fixes</a></h3>

<p>It is reasonable to post small snippets of code showing small changes
directly in the text in bug postings, or patch postings. For example, see
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13216&amp;atid=313216&amp;func=detail&amp;aid=824987">PATCH [ 824987 ] "Change binary-file detection (look only for zeros)"</a>,
which gives the change directly in the text.</p>

<p>Note, however, that sourceforge trackers currently ignore tabs, so if you
can convert tabs to spaces in your posting, it helps greatly.</p>

<p>Bugfixes may be treated less formally, especially for simple ones, or for
fixes to code you know well -- eg, you caused the bug yourself with a
recent patch :)</p>

<p>Consider still posting something to the tracker lists, even if it is
simply a summary in English. If the fix is something like
"misspelled variable name foo as fooz in many places", it is quite
understandable that you prefer to just fix the instances rather than
doing a full patch for it.</p>

<h3><a name="Coding_conventions">Coding conventions</a></h3>

<p>Please conform to the prevalent coding conventions. There are quite a number of
files which originated elsewhere, and have their own coding conventions; please
conform to the local one, in whichever files you are at work.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>WinMerge itself uses Microsoft MFC style coding.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code indents are purely tabs.</li>
      <li>
        Curly braces are on their own line, indented at the level of the outer code, and
        code inside the braces is indented one further level.
      </li>
      <li>Class member variables are usually prefixed with <code>m_</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crystal Text Editor (<code>WinMerge/editlib/*</code>) and diffutils code (<code>io.c</code>,
    <code>normal.c</code>, <code>util.c</code>) use traditional Unix style coding.
    <code>analyze.c</code> should be in this format, but we have made a mess of it :(</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code indents are spaces, with tabs used to abbreviate eight consecutive spaces.</li>
      <li>
        Curly braces are on their own line, indented two spaces, and then the code inside
        the curly braces is indented an additional two spaces.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="Doxygen_comments">Doxygen comments</a></h3>

<p>We have adopted <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">doxygen</a> style as our desired
commenting style for functions, classes, files, and so forth, in WinMerge code
(this applies only to native WinMerge code, not imported files).</p>

<ul>
  <li>We're using JavaDoc style comments.</li>
  <li>
    It is probably easiest to simply imitate existing examples. The functions in
    <code>DiffThread.cpp</code> are fully doxygen commented (<em>TODO: it would be better to give a
    class example, if anyone knows a fully doxygen commented class</em>).
  </li>
  <li>There is ready to use doxygen config file in <code>docs/developers/doxygen.cfg</code></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Revision_Ids">Revision IDs</a></h3>

<p>We have adopted the convention of using Revision ID lines near the top of our source
files (following the doxygen file header comments). Merely add these two lines
to any new file you add to the repository, and SVN will modify the Id line by
appending revision and date information at checkout:</p>

<pre>
// Revision ID line follows -- this is updated by SVN
// &#36;Id&#36;
</pre>

<h3><a name="File_release_numbers">File release numbers</a></h3>

<p>We are trying to keep a consistent numbering scheme on our file releases,
so everybody can figure out what we have released by just looking at the release number.
However, some of our older releases do not follow this scheme.</p>

<pre>
2.1.2.0
| | | |
| | | `------- This number increases for each experimental,
| | |          and it is reset after each beta or major release.
| | `--------- Denotes a beta release, an experimental release
| |            or a minor bug fix of a major release.
| |              even numbers means "stable" (i.e. a beta).
| |              odd numbers means "unstable" (i.e. an experimental).
| `----------- Denotes a major release.
|                even numbers means "stable".
|                odd numbers means "unstable".
`------------- Denotes a major release with major changes.
</pre>

<p>In this case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The next experimental release will have the number 2.1.3.0 (and then 2.1.3.1 and then 2.1.3.2 and so on)</li>
  <li>The next beta release will have the number 2.1.4.0</li>
  <li>The next major release will have the number 2.2.0.0</li>
</ul>
<p>And if we decide to rewrite most of the code, the next major release will have the number 3.0.0.0</p>

<h3><a name="Packaging_file_releases">Packaging file releases</a></h3>

<p>On SourceForge there is some space to enter Release Notes and Change Notes.
For experimental releases make sure to put in a note telling people that this is indeed experimental,
so they should not expect everything to work perfectly.
For beta builds we paste in all the changes since the last beta release, so that people can see exactly what changed.
For major releases, we paste in the list of changes since the last major release, and this list can become very long.</p>

<p>We are using <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">InnoSetup</a> to make
the installer for WinMerge.
See <a href="readme-developers-InnoSetup.html">readme-developers-InnoSetup.html</a> for more information.
Also zip-packages for releases are provided, zip up these files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>WinMerge.exe</code> and <code>WinMergeU.exe</code></li>
  <li><code>ShellExtension.dll</code>, <code>ShellExtensionU.dll</code>, <code>register.bat</code>
  and <code>unregister.bat</code> to register/unregister it.</li>
  <li>All filters from the <code>filters/</code> directory (remember template file!)</li>
  <li>All plugins from the <code>plugins/dlls/</code> directory. Create a <code>MergePlugins/</code> directory and copy the plugins to it</li>
  <li>All <code>*.lang</code> files (currently we have 21 languages, counting both Chinese versions)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please remember to put the version number into both executables. You may use
any of the following three methods at least.</p>
<ol>
 <li>
 You may run Src/SetResourceVersions.bat, which will prompt for the new
 version number, and set it both in Merge.rc and in all the translated rc files.
 </li><li>
 You may use
 <a href="http://www.elphin.com/products/stampver.html">StampVer</a> to stamp
 the version number into the executables after they are compiled.
 </li><li>
 You may also use the old-fashioned process
 of simply copying all the sources, changing the <code>Merge.rc</code> in the copy using
 the MSVC6 resource editor, and compiling that (many releases have been made in this
 manual, low-tech fashion).
 </li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever method you use, please double-check the
executable version numbers before uploading and releasing them.</p>

<p>
  Now that 2.4 release has translations for Shell Extension we must also carefully
  version it. If we don't update version number, installer won't install updated version.
  There are no scripts or other tools to update version number, it must be done by hand
  to <code>ShellExtension.rc</code> file (make sure you update all four numbers!). Version numbers
  follow the rule:
</p>
<pre>
1.6.1.0
| | | |
| | | `------- Not used - 0 (or your own build version?)
| | `--------- Translation updates or other minor changes increase this by one
| `----------- New features, bug fixes and other changes affecting to behavior
|                increase this number by one
`------------- Denotes a major release with major changes.
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure that version number is updated every time you do a new release!</li>
  <li>If there are only small changes not affecting behaviour or translation updates<br>
    - increase 3rd number by one</li>
  <li>If there's been new features, bug fixes or other non-minor changes<br>
    - increase 2nd number by one</li>
</ul>

<p>Filenames in file releases follow this standard:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>WinMerge-2.1.6.0-exe.zip</code></li>
  <li><code>WinMerge-2.1.6.0-src.zip</code></li>
  <li><code>WinMerge-2.1.6.0-Setup.exe</code></li>
</ul>

<p>That is, dots are used only inside the version number and before the final extension.</p>

<h3><a name="Tagging_SVN_when_releasing_files">Tagging Subversion when releasing files</a></h3>

<p>When we make a release we always put a note in <code>Src/Changes.txt</code> in SVN.</p>

<p>It is recommended to create a tag to the repository when making a stable- or beta- releases.
Although with subversion we have kind of tags for every commit (revision numbers) it is still a lot
easier to handle and remember them with human-readable names (R2_6_0) than with revision numbers
(revision 3637 (not a real revision number!)). Experimental or other testing releases don't need
tags since they are not intended for wide use and are usually just one-time snapshots.</p>

<p>The tag should follow the same numbering scheme as used above, with the dots replaced by underscores
and prefixed with an <code>R</code>, so the example experimental above would have a tag named <code>R2_1_3_0</code>,
the next beta would be named <code>R2_1_4</code>, and the next major release would be named <code>R2_2</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="Localization">Localization</a></h3>

<p><code>WinMerge.exe</code> and <code>WinMergeU.exe</code> are always compiled with the english resources.
Custom languages are in per-language PO files in <code>Languages</code> subfolder of WinMerge folder.
Language may be changed dynamically through the menu.</p>

<p>WinMerge localization is achieved by loading translated strings from per-language PO files. There is only one rc
file in the project <code>Merge.rc</code>, which is used to generate  POT (PO template) file. Per-language PO files
are updated (after <code>Merge.rc</code> changes) from generated POT file. All PO files are in same
<code>Languages</code> subfolder.

<p>Unlike with 2.6.x versions of WinMerge, there is no anymore need to compile language files. The same PO files
are used for translation and in runtime to load translated strings. This helps translating WinMerge a lot.

<p>If you have done changes to the <code>Merge.rc</code> file you must call <code>UpdateTranslations.bat</code>
to create the latest version from the file <code>English.pot</code> and update the language PO files from this PO template.
And for strings, who should not appear in the PO files just add a line in the <code>Languages/StringBlacklist.txt</code> file.</p>

<p class="note">Besides the resources files you could also translate things like the
<a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/winmerge/trunk/WinMerge/InnoSetup/Languages/">installer</a>
(the ISL files are just INI files) and the <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/winmerge/trunk/WinMerge/Docs/Users/Languages/">readme files</a>.</p>

<h4>Tips for developers :</h4>
<ul>
  <li><p>The code must use resource strings for all messages, or displayed text (column title ...).</p></li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Strings ID</strong>: when applying a patch, you may define new strings (with as ID the first free ID).
    But probably you wrote your patch from an old version, and someone may have already inserted a patch for this ID.
    You need to adapt the ID in resource.h to avoid overlapping ID.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Strings order</strong>: that is really annoying with MSVC. It is important to keep the order of strings unchanged,
    because merging rc files with WinMerge is then a lot easier. Strings are grouped in block according to their ID masked by <code>0xFFF0</code>.
    So there are at most 16 strings in a block, but maybe less. MSVC reorders strings between and inside blocks, but never reorders blocks
    (when a new blocks is created, MSVC always put it at the last position).</p>
    <p>Typical method to merge strings in a <code>Merge.rc</code> from a patch with a <code>Merge.rc</code> in SVN :</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Add your new strings with WinMerge : <code>resource.h</code> for ID, and <code>Merge.rc</code>.</li>
      <li>If no overlapping ID, you are finished.</li>
      <li>Update your ID in <code>resource.h</code>.</li>
      <li>
        Open your resource file in MSVC. Force compilation (I just change a string twice, add a space, delete this space,
        then save). So MSVC classes new strings in blocks (possibly creating new blocks) according to the ID updated in 3.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Blocks are not really ordered (there order comes from history), it is not a problem as MSVC never reorders
    blocks after creation. If you use another tool to change resources, please make sure that the blocks order is unchanged.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Logging">Logging</a></h3>

<p>Logs are a good tool for tracing errors. But logs must be first written. Its always
a good habit to write error message to logfile also.</p>

<h4>Writing to log:</h4>
<p>Simplest way to write errormessage to log is using
<code>void LogErrorString(LPCTSTR sz)</code> defined in <code>stdafx.h</code>. Another
way is to directly use <code>gLog</code> which is global instance of
<code>CLogFile</code>. Log is written to users temporary directory (<code>$temp</code>) with name
<code>WinMerge.log</code>.</p>

<h4>Enabling/disabling log writing</h4>
<p>Log writing is controlled by registry value:</p>
<pre>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Thingamahoochie\WinMerge\Settings\Logging</pre>

<p>Possible values are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0 - no logging</li>
  <li>1 - all logging enabled</li>
  <li>2 - only errormessages and warnings written to log</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="ShellExt">Shell Extension</a></h3>

<p>WinMerge sets executable path (<code>WinMerge.exe</code>) which shellextension starts every
time when options-dialog is closed. This can cause problems when testing
several versions of WinMerge. There is registry value to overwrite path to
WinMerge executable:</p>

<pre>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Thingamahoochie\WinMerge\PriExecutable</pre>

<p>It does not exist by default, so create <code>PriExecutable</code> as string value and type
path of <code>WinMerge.exe</code> you mainly use as its value. If this value exists
ShellExtension does not care about another path value.</p>

<h4>Compiling for 64-bit Windows</h4>
<p>This is a bit tricky, and needs some patience to setup.</p>

<h5>Needed tools</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Visual Studio 2003 or later (Might work for earlier, but I haven't tried it)</li>
  <li>Platform SDK (for Windows 2003 SP1) with at least following components installed:
    <ul>
      <li>Configuration Options</li>
      <li>Microsoft Windows Core SDK <strong>with tools and build environments</strong></li>
      <li>Microsoft Web Workshop (IE) SDK</li>
      <li>Microsoft Data Access Services (MDAC) SDK <i>not sure about this</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Starting Visual Studio and opening the project</h5>
<p>We need to start Visual Studio from Platform SDK's 64-bit environment so that we get all
needed environment variables and paths correctly set. So:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start 64-bit Platform SDK environment:<br>
    From Start menu: Platform SDK --> Open Build Environment Window --> Windows XP/2003 64-bit
    environment --> Release/Debug environment</li>
  <li>CD to Visual Studio install folder/Common7/IDE</li>
  <li>Start Visual Studio with command:<br>
    <code>devenv /USEENV (uses open environment)</code></li>
  <li>Open <code>ShellExtensionX64.vcproj</code> from <code>ShellExtension</code> project
    folder.</li>
</ol>

<p>Make sure you have 64-bit target selected in Project Settings. Then check that paths are OK.
You <strong>MUST</strong> build to separate directory than 32-bit targets so that files don't
mix up.</p>

<p>Compiling should now succeed. If not, check that all needed PSDK components are installed
and that paths are OK. If you are compiling in 32-bit Windows you get error about registering
but that is expected to happen.</p>

<p>64-bit ShellExtension is registered to 64-bit Windows just like counterparts in 32-bit world:<br>
<code>regsvr ShellExtensionX64.dll</code></p>
