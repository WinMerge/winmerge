    <title>Navigation in directory compare</title>
    <para>In addition moving selection using mouse or keyboard, also Merge-menu navigation commands, toolbar buttons and shortcut keys can be used. For example "Next diff" finds next different file and selects it.</para>
    <note>
      <para>Unique files and directories are considered as different ones.</para>

      <title>Copying and deleting</title>
      <para></para>
      <para>Directory compare allows user to copy and delete files and directories. File operations are available through context menu (right-click with mouse). Also files can be opened to associated program or into external editor.</para>
      <para>In file operation menu, there are one or two numbers shown, depending on files/folders selected. If there is one number shown, for example "Copy/Left to... (5)" that means there is 5 items selected, and all items can be copied. But if there is two numbers shown, for example "Copy/Left to... (3 of 5)", that means there are 5 items selected but only 3 items can be copied.</para>
      <para>Most common operation is copying files from side to side. File can be copied from side to side using Merge-menu items, toolbar buttons and context menu. If multiple files are selected, or file to overwrite is read-only, confirmation dialog is shown.</para>
      <para>Sometimes it is useful to copy certain files and/or directories to another directory instead of another compared directory. This can be done selecting "Copy/Left to..." or "Copy/Right to..." items.</para>
      <para>Another file/directory operation is deleting. Items in another or both sides can be deleted. There is "Put deleted files into recycle bin" option in system options. Its higly recommended to keep that option enabled so deletion can be undone if accidents happen. Note however recycle bin does not help if its disabled from Windows settings.</para>
      <warning>
        <para>File/directory deletion cannot be undone if recycle bin is not used!!!</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>With ...</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>First one opens file with application registered handling filetype for Windows, if there is one. Second opens file with external editor configurable in options (Notepad by default). Last one opens "Open With..." dialog asking from user with which application files should be opened.</para>
    </sect3>
    <sect3>
      <title>Archiving</title>
      <para>Selected items or different items from selection can be added to archive file.</para>
      <note>
        <para>Archive support requires that compatible version of 7-zip is installed to system.</para>
      </note>
      <para>After selecting archive item dialog pops up asking filename and archive type from user.</para>

    <para>There are many ways to customize directory compare:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Sorting by column : Sorted by column can be selected by clicking column name with mouse. Little arrow appears next to column name indicating that results are sorted by this column and sort order.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Selecting visible columns : "Display Columns" dialog can be opened from Tools -menu or by right-clicking column header with mouse.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Changing order of columns : Order can be changed in "Display Columns" dialor or by drag &amp; dropping column names with mouse.</para>

    <title>Protecting directories / read-only directories</title>
    <para>If user wants to protect one or both sides from changes, user can set them to read-only from File-menu.</para>
    <important>
      <para>Setting read-only protects files and directories in current compare view only.</para>
    </important>
    <para>Protected status is inherited to opened files from directory compare. If user compares two directories, sets another to protected and opens two files for comparing, file opened from protected side has protection set too.</para>
    <para>Protection status is shown in statusbar, there are panes for left and right side.</para>
