  <title>Comparing Folders</title>

  <para>The Folder compare window displays all of the files and subfolders
  compared in a sortable list view. Files and subfolders may be synchronized
  by copying or deleting, and actions may be performed on multiple items
  simultaneously. The columns displayed may be changed and reordered.</para>

  <para>Folder comparison has two different modes. The mode is selected in the
  Open dialog with the "<guilabel>Include
  Subfolders</guilabel>"-checkbox.<itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>When subfolders are included, all subfolders and their contents
        are compared. Files are displayed depending on the options on the
        <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu (eg, <guimenuitem>Show Identical
        Files</guimenuitem>). Common folders are never displayed (but all
        files inside of them are). Folders only existing on one side are
        displayed according to the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu options (eg,
        <guimenuitem>Show Left Unique Files</guimenuitem>).</para>

        <para>This mode does not allow browsing folders and can be slow if
        there are many subfolders and files. But it is easy to see and handle
        different files in whole folder structure.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>When subfolders are not included only files in selected folders
        and names of subfolders are shown.</para>

        <para>This mode allows browsing folders by opening subfolders and
        parent folders. This mode has the advantage of speed, as it may be
        much faster when there are many subfolders that need not be examined.
        Also the display may be easier to manage, showing only items in one
        folder.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist></para>

  <para>WinMerge 2.4 is finally capable to compare large binary files. There
  is new <guilabel>Compare by Quick Contents</guilabel> -compare method which
  makes it possible. For more information about different compare methods see
  <link linkend="Configuration">Options &amp; configuration</link> -chapter.
  In WinMerge 2.4 all files bigger than 4 MB (megabytes) are automatically
  compared with Compare by Quick Contents -method. Downsides for this method
  are that linefilters do not work and there is no difference counts
  information in folder compare UI. For most cases this should not matter
  since so big files usually are binary files.</para>

  <para>For advanced users: If that limit does not feel good (you have lots of
  big text files) it can be changed via registry value:
  <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Thingamahoochie\WinMerge\Settings\QuickMethodLimit</code>.
  As usual be careful when changing values directly to registry!</para>

    <title>Compare Results</title>

    <para>Files and folders are compared and divided into several categories.
    Categories are easy to recognize from these icons:<simplelist>

              <imagedata fileref="screenshots/aborted.png" />
            </imageobject>
          </inlinemediaobject> Aborted item. WinMerge did not finish comparing
        this item when compare was stopped. Result is unknown.</member>
      </simplelist></para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Folder Compare Status</title>

    <para>During the folder comparison WinMerge shows status panel:</para>

    <para><mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="screenshots/foldercmp_progress.png" format="PNG" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject></para>

    <para>The panel shows approximate status and progress of the compare.
    Status is shown as a number of items and a progressbar. Numbers show how
    many items (files and folders) WinMerge has found to compare. Progressbar
    shows same info graphically.</para>

    <important>
      <para>Progressbar is for item counts. As there usually are different
      sized files in compare it does not directly map to time used/remaining.
      So 50/100 items does not strictly mean compare is in half by time
      used.</para>
    </important>

    <para>Folder compare can be stopped by selecting
    <guibutton>Stop</guibutton>-button and results for files and folders
    compared so far are shown. When compare is stopped before it finishes,
    some files may be in middle of comparison. Those files are marked as
    <guilabel>Aborted</guilabel> in comparison results. It means result is not
    available for them.</para>

    <para>When folder compare is ready status panel is closed and results are
    shown.</para>

    <note>
      <para>This is one of most visible changes in WinMerge version 2.6. New
      status panel may feel "just too simple" after using previous WinMerge
      versions. The fact is most of the details in previous versions were
      useless during the compare. So simplicity was choosen for new design.
      Automatic closing may also feel weird at starters. But there is no
      information visible that would be needed after the compare.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Compare statistics are visible in separate dialog which can be
    opened after compare from menu: <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>View</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Compare Statistics</guimenuitem>

    <para>Browsing folders is only possible when subfolders are not included
    to compare (<guilabel>Include Subfolders</guilabel> checkbox is not
    checked in <guilabel>Open</guilabel>-dialog). Parent folders
    ("<guilabel>..</guilabel>"-item) and subfolders existing in both sides can
    be compared by double-clicking with mouse over them or selecting them and
    pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap>.</para>

    <para>Parent folder can be opened if it is not same directory. These two
    icons indicate if parent folder can be opened:</para>

    <title>Navigation in Folder Compare</title>

    <para>In addition moving selection using mouse or keyboard, also
    <guimenu>Merge</guimenu>-menu navigation commands, toolbar buttons and
    shortcut keys can be used. For example "<guimenuitem>Next
    diff</guimenuitem>" finds next different file and selects it.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Unique files and folders are considered as different ones.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Multiple files/folders can be selected. However not all operations
    are possible with multi-selection.</para>

  <sect2>
    <title>File Operations in Folder Compare</title>

    <sect3>
      <title>Copying, moving and deleting</title>

      <para>Folder compare allows user to copy and delete files and folders.
      File operations are available through context menu (right-click with
      mouse). Also files can be opened to associated program or into external
      editor.</para>

      <para>In file operation menu, there are one or two numbers shown,
      depending on files/folders selected. If there is one number shown, for
      example "<guimenuitem>Copy/Left to... (5)</guimenuitem>" that means
      there is 5 items selected, and all items can be copied. But if there is
      two numbers shown, for example "<guimenuitem>Copy/Left to... (3 of
      5)</guimenuitem>", that means there are 5 items selected but only 3
      items can be copied.</para>

      <para>Most common operation is copying files from side to side. File can
      be copied from side to side using <guimenu>Merge</guimenu>-menu items,
      toolbar buttons and context menu. If multiple files are selected, or
      file to overwrite is read-only, confirmation dialog is shown.</para>

      <para>Sometimes it is useful to copy certain files and/or directories to
      another directory instead of another compared directory. This can be
      done selecting "<guimenuitem>Copy/Left to...</guimenuitem>" or
      "<guimenuitem>Copy/Right to...</guimenuitem>" items.</para>

      <para>Another file/folder operation is deleting. Items in another or
      both sides can be deleted. There is "<guilabel>Send deleted files into
      Recycle Bin</guilabel>" option in system options (See <link
      linkend="Configuration">Options &amp; Configuration</link> -chapter). It
      is highly recommended to keep that option enabled so deletion can be
      undone if accidents happen. Note however recycle bin does not help if
      its disabled from Windows settings.</para>

      <para>Moving is just shortcut for copy + delete.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>File/folder deletion cannot be undone if <guilabel>Recycle
        Bin</guilabel> is not used!</para>
      </warning>
    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Renaming</title>

      <para>Renaming files and folders is available through context menu item
      <guimenuitem>Rename</guimenuitem> or using <keycap>F2</keycap> -shortcut
      key. Edit-box appears and allows editing of the name. Renaming can be
      cancelled by pressing <keycap>Esc</keycap> -key. Note that items in both
      sides are renamed. Renaming just other side is not currently
      possible.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Opening files</title>

      <para>There are three items in <guimenu>Open</guimenu>-menus:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <simpara><guimenuitem>With Registered Application</guimenuitem> :
          Opens file with application registered for editing filetype for
          Windows, if there is one.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara><guimenuitem>With External Editor</guimenuitem> : Open with
          external editor. Default editor can be selected from options,
          Notepad is used by default.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara><guimenuitem>With ...</guimenuitem> : Opens "<guilabel>Open
          With...</guilabel>" dialog asking from user with which application
          files should be opened.</simpara>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <tip>
        <para>Selecting <guilabel>With Registered Application</guilabel> when
        folder is selected usually opens that folder into new Explorer
        window.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Archiving</title>

      <para><guimenu>Zip</guimenu>-menu in directory compare context menu
      allows adding selected items to archive file.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Archive support requires that 7-Zip plugin is installed to
        system.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Zip-submenumenu has four items:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <simpara><guimenuitem>Left...</guimenuitem> : Adds left-side files
          and folders (recursively) to the archive file</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara><guimenuitem>Right...</guimenuitem> : Adds right-side files
          and folders (recursively) to the archive file</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara><guimenuitem>Both...</guimenuitem> : Adds files and folders
          (recursively) from both sides to the archive file. Because filenames
          are same, files must be put to subfolders inside archive. Left-side
          files are put to subfolder <filename
          class="directory">Original/</filename> and right-side files are put
          to subfolder <filename
          class="directory">Altered/</filename>.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara><guimenuitem>Differences...</guimenuitem> : This is like
          above <guimenuitem>Both</guimenuitem>, but this item adds only
          different files (including unique files) from both sides.</simpara>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>After selecting one of <guimenu>Zip</guimenu>-menu items dialog
      pops up asking filename and archive type from user. WinMerge cannot add
      files to existing archive files but it always creates new archive
      file.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>WinMerge looks for subfolders <filename
        class="directory">Original/</filename> and <filename
        class="directory">Altered/</filename> in archive files. If archive
        file contains these subfolders and same filename is given to both
        sides WinMerge compares contents of those two folders.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>If directory compare shows contents of archive files WinMerge
      updates changes done to files in file compare into original archive
      file. But WinMerge does not update archive contents for files
      added/deleted/copied. User can create a new archive file using above
      menuitems instead.</para>
    </sect3>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Copying Path- or Filenames</title>

    <para>In context menu there are items for copying selected items' paths or
    filenames to clipboard. This feature makes it easy so get list of changed
    files, for changelogs etc.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara><guimenuitem>Copy Pathnames</guimenuitem> has three
        subchoices like other file handling functions. It copies full
        pathnames of selected items to clipboard, one per line.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara><guimenuitem>Copy Filenames</guimenuitem> copies only

    <title>Protecting Folders / Read-only Folders</title>

    <para>If user wants to protect one or both sides from changes, user can
    set them to read-only from <guimenu>File</guimenu>-menu.</para>

    <important>
      <para>Setting read-only protects files and folders in current compare
      view only.</para>
    </important>

    compare. If user compares two folders, sets another to protected and opens
    two files for comparing, file opened from protected side has protection
    set too.</para>

    <title>Hiding Items</title>

    <para>Selected items can be hidden from view using context menu item
    <guimenuitem>Hide Items</guimenuitem>. Hidden items are not shown until
    next refresh is done. All hidden items can be re-shown selecting
    <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>View</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Show Hidden Items</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>.</para>

    <para>Hiding items is handy to remove already handled items from the view.
    So when you have merged files, use context menu item to hide them. It is a
    lot easier to see what items are left to merge. Get used to it! It saves
    your time!</para>

    <title>Refreshing Only Selected Items</title>

    <para>Full refresh of large folders can take a long time. In 2.2 and
    earlier versions of WinMerge user always had to do full refresh after
    editing files outside WinMerge. WinMerge 2.4 can refresh just selected
    items. Select <guimenuitem>Refresh</guimenuitem> from context menu.</para>
