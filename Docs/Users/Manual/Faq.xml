        <question>
          <para>Does WinMerge run on older Windows versions?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para><indexterm>
              <primary>WinMerge executables, Unicode and ANSI</primary>
            </indexterm><indexterm>
              <primary>Unicode</primary>
              <secondary>WinMerge support</secondary>
            </indexterm><indexterm>
              <primary>ANSI</primary>
              <secondary>WinMerge support</secondary>
            </indexterm>Beginning with Version 2.14, WinMerge ended support for
	    older 32-bit Windows systems, including Windows 9x, ME, and NT4.
	    In addition, WinMerge version 2.16 does not support Windows 2000.</para>
          <para>Previously, WinMerge provided an ANSI (8-bit) executable,
              <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename>, that was designed around the
            old Windows codepages. <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> internally
            stored only the ANSI characters supported by the Windows codepage.
            This executable had severe limitations for working with Unicode: if
            you opened a Unicode file, the characters were converted to the
            Windows ANSI codepage. Because there are over 100,000 Unicode
            characters, and only 256 can be represented in the ANSI character
            set, data loss could occur. Conversion might be approximate (for
            example, accents are lost) or impossible: characters were replaced
            by question marks ( <literal>?</literal> ).</para>
          <para><filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> also could not open files with
            names outside the current ANSI codepage. For example, on an English
            system, <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> could not open a file with
            a Hebrew name.</para>
          <para>WinMerge developed the Unicode-enabled
              <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename> executable to work with newer,
            Unicode-based Windows systems. <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename>
            has none of the limitations of the ANSI executable.</para>
          <para><filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename> has been installed by default
            for some time, and since few ANSI-based Windows systems remain, the
            value of maintaining <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> is miminal.
            As of Version 2.14, WinMerge no longer includes
              <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> in the installer.  </para>

          Do not select any of the files or subfolders, just click

          is displayed in the <guilabel>File name</guilabel> field. If you
          already selected a files or subfolders, just type a random string in
          the <guilabel>File name</guilabel> field and click
          <guibutton>Open</guibutton>. If the file name you enter is not found,
          WinMerge opens the folder.</para>

            </indexterm></para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Providing an integration with CVS is of questionable value
          because there already are so many good CVS clients. However, WinMerge
          does provide an integration with the diff function of one of those
          clients, TortoiseCVS (as described in <xref
          linkend="Version_control" />). Also, WinMerge can resolve conflict
          files (see <xref linkend="ResolveConflictFiles" />).</para>

        <answer>
          <para>MRU is an abbreviation for <quote>Most Recently Used</quote>,
          and refers to the history lists in the Select Files or Folders dialog.

        <question>
          <para>Can WinMerge open OpenOffice files?<indexterm>
              <primary>OpenOffice, opening files in WinMerge</primary>
            </indexterm></para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>OpenOffice files are archives. To be able to open them in
          WinMerge, you have to configure archive support:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>In WinMerge, click the <guibutton>Options</guibutton> button
              (or click <menuchoice>
                  <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>

                  <guimenuitem>Options</guimenuitem>
                </menuchoice>). In the Archive Support page, enable the
              <guilabel>Detect archive type from file signature</guilabel>
              option</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
        <question>
          <para>Why do large files sometimes show up as different in the Folder
          Compare window, but identical in the File Compare window?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This is because WinMerge always uses the <guilabel>Quick
          Contents</guilabel> file compare method for large files. This method
          enables WinMerge to compare large files more efficiently. To test if
          this is causing the behavior you're seeing, you can try raising the
          <guilabel>Quick Contents</guilabel> threshold for large files. See the
          discussion of this method in <xref linkend="Compare_dirs_starting" />
          to learn how.</para>

        <question>
          <para>Why do my files have all lines marked as different (colored),
          even though I know all the lines are not different?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Maybe your files have different line ending styles (for example,
          Windows and Unix). By default, WinMerge compares line ending styles.
          To disable it, click <menuchoice>

        <question>
          <para>I see question marks instead of letters in files.</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This is what we call a <glossterm>lossy
          conversion</glossterm>.</para>
          <!--<para>For Unicode files (UCS-2, UTF-8), use <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename>.</para>-->

          <para>For ANSI files, this is probably due to code-page problems. To
          troubleshoot, click <menuchoice>
              <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>

              <guimenuitem>Options</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice>. Then in the Codepages page, see if the option
          <guilabel>Detect codepage info</guilabel> is checked. If it is,
          deselect the option, click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>, and see if that
          helps.</para>

        <question>
          <para>What is <glossterm>delay of automatic rescan</glossterm>? Why it
          is needed?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>When <guilabel>Automatic Rescan</guilabel> is enabled (in the
          Editor page of Options), WinMerge delays rescanning while you edit
          files. That is, no rescanning occurs until shortly after you stop
          typing. Without this delay, WinMerge would rescan after every typed
          character, making the editing process too slow. The delay especially
          improves editing bigger files, which can take several seconds to
          rescan.</para>

          <para>Yes, there is basic printing support: click <menuchoice>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Perry-style patches are zip files containing original and
          changed files in different directories. WinMerge has internal support
          (surprise!) for handling these files: just launch a compare operation,
          selecting the zip file for both the left and right sides. WinMerge
          opens the contents of the zip file in a Folder Compare window,
          comparing the original and changed files.</para>
