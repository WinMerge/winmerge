        <question>
          <para>Why are there two executable files,
          <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> and
          <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename>?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> is an ANSI (8-bit)
              executable which works in all 32-bit Windows systems. It does
              not have Unicode support.</para>

              <para>Internally, it stores only ANSI characters (256
              possibilities). If you open a Unicode file, the characters must
              be converted to the ANSI codepage. As there are over 100,000
              Unicode characters, and only 256 can be represented in the ANSI
              codepage, data loss may occur. Conversion may be approximative
              (accents are lost), or impossible (characters appear as
              "?").</para>

              <para><filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> also can not open files
              with names outside the current ANSI codepag (e.g., WinMerge.exe
              can not open a file with a Hebrew name, if run on an English
              system. WinMergeU.exe can open such files.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename> is a Unicode enabled
              executable which works on Windows NT4, Windows 2000, and newer
              systems.</para>

          <para>When wanting to compare folders, I cannot select a folder in
          Browse-dialog?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Browse to the folder you want to compare (folder contents is
          shown in the dialog). Do not select any of the files or subfolders,
          just select the <guibutton>Open</guibutton>-button when
          "<guilabel>Folder Selection</guilabel>" is shown in filename
          editbox. If you already selected any of the files or subfolders,
          just write some nonsense to the filename editbox and select the
          Open-button. When the filename editbox doesn't contain any existing
          filename then WinMerge opens the folder.</para>

        <question>
          <para>Does WinMerge support merging three files? Sometimes it is
          called 3-way merge, where one file is ancestor. This would be useful
          for version control!</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Unfortunately not. We acknowledge it would be good feature but
          have no plans to implement it in near future. This can be somewhat
          worked around by using two WinMerge instances. (One developer has
          begun preliminary work on this feature, but it is not yet available,
          even in experimental releases.)</para>

        <answer>
          <para>Which kind of CVS integration WinMerge should have? Adding CVS
          client features to WinMerge is questionable since there are many
          good CVS clients already. Conflict file resolution is a feature we
          are planning to add in future releases.</para>

        <question>
          <para>Why do large files sometimes show as different in the folder
          view, but come up as identical in the merge editor?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This is because WinMerge uses the "<guilabel>Quick
          Compare</guilabel>" method for large files always. It allows
          WinMerge to compare large files more efficiently. To test if this is
          causing the behavior you're seeing, you could raise the limit for
          the <guilabel>Quick Compare</guilabel> threshold for large files. It
          is stored in the registry as:</para>

          <screen>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Thingamahoochie\WinMerge\Settings\QuickMethodLimit</screen>

          <para>You may consider raising this limit if you constantly compare
          large text files. Be careful to not raise it too much "for just to
          be sure". 100 MB is too much.</para>

          <para>The default value for the limit is 4MB (0x400000).</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Mentioned files are plugins written with Visual Basic (6.0).
          WinMerge installer does not contain Visual Basic runtime files so
          those plugins cannot be loaded. You can:</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>If you are using <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> (not
          <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename>), then your files may be Unicode
          files. <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> cannot handle Unicode
          files. Please try comparing files with
          <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename> if you have Windows NT4, Windows

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Windows registry files
          (<filename><replaceable>*</replaceable>.reg</filename>) are Unicode
          files (UTF-16 or UCS-2) -- see the question "<link

        <question>
          <para>WinMerge tells my files are binary files even when they are
          not?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>There is one or more zero-bytes in your file(s). If WinMerge
          finds zero-bytes from files, it considers the files to be binary
          files. You can try to remove those zero-bytes from files.
          Alternatively, you may open the files with the DisplayBinaryFiles
          plugin. This plugin allows viewing binary files, but not editing
          them. If you have a very recent version of WinMerge (2.6.0 and
          newer), you may use the new EditBinaryFiles plugin, which does allow
          editing binary files (using an escape scheme for representing
          non-printable characters).</para>

          <para>For ANSI files, this is probably due to code-page problems. If

          <para>What is delaying of (automatic) rescan? Why it is

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>When <guilabel>Automatic Rescan</guilabel> is enabled,
          WinMerge delays rescanning while user edits files. So there is no
          rescanning happening when user types text but shortly after user has
          finished typing. Without this delaying WinMerge would do rescan
          after every typed letter and editing files would become slow. This
          delaying especially improves editing of bigger files which can take
          several seconds to rescan.</para>

          install all the files WinMerge needs (namely
          <filename>7zip_pad.xml</filename> in 7-Zip program folder). Download

        <answer>
          <para>"Perry-style" patches are zip-files containing original and
          changed files in different directories. WinMerge has internal
          support (surprise?) for handling these files. Just select zip file

          contents to folder compare comparing original and altered

          <para>No. It may be added in later versions but until then Win32
          port of diffutils can be used. The Win32 port of diffutils (and
          patch) can be downloaded from <application>GnuWin32</application>

          <para>No. The patch tool from GnuWin32 project can be used for patch
          applying since WinMerge produces GNU/diffutils compatible patch
          files. See above question.</para>
