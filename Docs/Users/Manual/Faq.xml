        <question>
          <para>Why is there two executable files,
          <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> and
          <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename>?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> is ANSI executable which
              works in all 32-bit Windows systems. It does not have Unicode
              support.</para>

              <para>Internally, it stores only ANSI characters (256
              possibilities). If you open an Unicode (65536 possible
              characters) file, the characters must be converted to the ANSI
              character set. Conversion can be approximative (accents are
              lost), or impossible (characters appear as "?").</para>

              <para><filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> can neither open files
              when filename is not writeable in the current ANSI set.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename> is Unicode enabled
              executable which works in Windows NT4, Windows 2000 and newer
              systems.</para>

          <para>When wanting to compare directories, I cannot select a
          directory in Browse?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Are you trying to select a directory by clicking on it in the
          upper part of the Open File dialog ? The Open File dialog will then
          open it, and you have to push <guibutton>Ok</guibutton> again to get
          out.</para>

        <question>
          <para>Does WinMerge support merging three files? Sometimes it is
          called 3-way merge, where one file is ancestor. This would be useful
          for version control!</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Unfortunately not. We acknowledge it would be good feature but
          have no plans to implement it in near future. This can be somewhat
          work-arounded using two WinMerge instances.</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Not currently. If somebody wants to help/work with
          cross-platform support (using <ulink
          url="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</ulink> for example) we
          are interested of course.</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Which kind of CVS integration WinMerge should have? Adding CVS
          client features to WinMerge is questionable since there are many
          good CVS clients already. Conflict file resolution is feature we are
          planning to add in future releases.</para>

          <para>MRU is the abbreviation for "Most Recently Used", and means
          the history lists in Open-dialog thats containing 20 last used

    <title>Questions about binary files</title>

        <question>
          <para>WinMerge says "<guilabel>Binary files are
          different</guilabel>", but I am not comparing binary files?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>If you are using <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> (not
          <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename>), then your files may be Unicode
          files. <filename>WinMerge.exe</filename> cannot handle Unicode
          files. Please try comparing files with
          <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename> if you have Windows NT4, Windows
          2000 or newer Windows version.</para>

          (<filename><replaceable>*</replaceable>.reg</filename>)?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Windows registry files

          <para>Try selecting a different font from menu <menuchoice>
              <guimenu>View</guimenu>

              <guimenuitem>Select Font...</guimenuitem>

        <question>
          <para>I would like to see the line numbers?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>WinMerge shows current line in editor statusbar. WinMerge
          cannot show in-editor linenumbers. That is one feature we might
          consider for future releases.</para>

        <question>
          <para>I see question marks instead of letters in files?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>This is what we call a "lossy" conversion.</para>

          <para>For Unicode files (UCS-2, UTF-8), use
          <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename>.</para>

          <para>For ANSI files, this is probably due to code-page problem. If
          "<guilabel>Use codepage info</guilabel>" is selected from
          <guimenuitem>Options</guimenuitem>, turn that off and see if it
          helps.</para>

        <question>
          <para>I cannot select proportional fonts for editor?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Unfortunately WinMerge 2.0 and 2.2 supports only
          non-proportional fonts.</para>

        <question>
          <para>What means delaying of (automatic) rescan? Why it is
          needed?</para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>When <guilabel>Automatic Rescan</guilabel> is enabled WinMerge
          delays rescanning while user edits files. So there is no rescanning
          happening when user types text but shortly after user has finished
          typing. Without this delaying WinMerge would do rescan after every
          typed letter and editing files would become slow. This delaying
          especially improves editing of bigger files which can take several
          seconds to rescan.</para>

        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>"Perry-style" patches are zip-files containing original and
          changed files in different directories. WinMerge has internal
          support (surprise?) for handling these files. Just select zip file
          in question to left side and right side and WinMerge opens zip files
          contents to directory compare comparing original and altered
          files.</para>

              <para>If it says "<guilabel>ANSI</guilabel>", the file is

        <answer>
          <para>No. It may be added in later versions but until then Win32

          can be downloaded from <productname>GnuWin32</productname> project
