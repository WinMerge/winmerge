  <title>Getting and Installing WinMerge</title>

  <para>WinMerge can be installed using installer or by unzipping files from
  archive. Using the installer is the recommended method.</para>

  <para>Currently WinMerge installer works for natively for 32-bit Windows.
  There is no separate version for 64-bit Windows (WinXP/2003/Vista) but those
  can run installer and WinMerge as 32-bit application. However there is
  64-bit version of Shell Integration included in 32-bit installer. So Shell
  Integration works in 64-bit Windows.</para>

    <title>Getting Files</title>

    <para>Latest releases can be always downloaded from WinMerge homepage:
    <ulink url="http://www.winmerge.org/">WinMerge.org</ulink>. Note that
    there may be some delay updating homepages for the latest releases, but
    project statuspage at <ulink
    url="https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmerge/">SourceForge.net</ulink>
    shows the latest files. There is also a mailing-list for release
    announcements. Stable releases are also available in several file download
    sites.</para>

    <title>Using the Installer (recommended)</title>

    <note>
      <para>Installer requires Admin-user priviledges in Windows NT4/2000/XP.
      If you don't have Admin-user priviledges you can install WinMerge by
      unzipping from an archive file (see <link
      linkend="InstallFromArchive">Installing from an
      Archive</link>).</para>
    </note>

    <para>This is recommended for most users. Installer asks location where
    WinMerge is installed, installs files, configures shell integration and
    adds WinMerge to <guimenu>Start</guimenu>-menu. To install
    WinMerge:</para>

    <title id="InstallFromArchive">Installing from an Archive</title>

    <para>WinMerge is pretty much independent from other system components. It
    doesn't integrate tightly to Windows or use lots of dlls.
    <filename>WinMerge[U].exe</filename> itself is dependent of
    <filename>MFC71[U].dll</filename> , <filename>MSVCR71.dll and
    MSVCP71.dll</filename> in addition to some system DLLs. So if mentioned
    DLLs already are installed to system, only
    <filename>WinMerge[U].exe</filename> is needed to run WinMerge. Mentioned
    DLL files are available also as Runtimes-package to download.</para>

    <para>Archive files have correct folder structure. WinMerge should be
    unzipped preserving folder structure to destination folder, for example
    <filename class="directory">C:\Program Files\</filename>. Root folder
    created has name <filename
    class="directory">/WinMerge-<replaceable>version</replaceable></filename>,
    for example <filename class="directory">/WinMerge-2.6.0</filename>. This
    folder can be renamed or files copied to other folder (preserving folder
    structure!).</para>

    <para>After unzipping files WinMerge is ready to run! Shell Integration
    and Archive Integration may need additional steps (see below).</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Shell Integration</title>

    <para>Choose "<guilabel>Enable Explorer context menu
    integration</guilabel>" from installer's additional features to install
    Shell Integration.</para>

    <para>If install program is not used, Shell Integration dll
    (<filename>ShellExtension*.dll</filename>) must be registered separately.
    This is done by running <filename>register.bat</filename> from WinMerge
    directory. Restarting the computer is recommended after installing Shell
    Integration so that Windows updates all its references.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Installing shell Integration requires administrative user
      priviledges.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Updating the Shell Integration outside the installer requires first
    uninstalling current Shell Intregration version. Uninstalling can be done
    by running <filename>unregister.bat</filename> from WinMerge directory.
    After that the computer should be restarted so Windows completes
    uninstallation. Then the new version can be installed like described
    above.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>64-Bit Shell Integration</title>

      <para>WinMerge version 2.6 includes a partial support for 64-bit Windows
      versions by including 64-bit Shell Integration. WinMerge installer
      recognizes 64-bit versions of Windows and can install correct version of
      Shell Integration.</para>

      <para>When installing Shell Integration by hand from an archive file,
      Shell Integration dll is named as
      <filename>ShellExtensionX64.dll</filename>. Registering/unregistering
      can be done with <filename>register.bat</filename> and
      <filename>unregister.bat</filename> like with 32-bit versions.</para>
    </sect3>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>7-Zip and Archive Support</title>

    <para>WinMerge uses <ulink url="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</ulink> for
    archive support, but WinMerge installer does not install 7-Zip or archive
    support. Installing 7-Zip application is recommended but not required for
    archive support. 7-Zip installer can be downloaded from <ulink
    url="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip.org</ulink>.</para>

    <para>To install archive support, download and install 7-Zip plugin
    (Merge7zInstaller, see below) from <ulink
    url="http://www.winmerge.org/">WinMerge.org</ulink>.</para>

    <para>WinMerge automatically detects installed 7-zip in system, there is
    no need to any configuration.</para>

    <para>7-zip integration needs compatible <filename>Merge7z*.dll</filename>
    file in WinMerge program directory. <filename>*</filename> comes from
    7-Zip version installed. For example 7-Zip version 4.42 needs
    <filename>Merge7z442.dll</filename>. And if
    <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename> (unicode version) is used, then
    "<filename>U</filename>" is also added to filename:
    <filename>Merge7z442U.dll</filename>. If needed dll file is for some
    reason missing it can be copied to WinMerge directory, for example from
    7z-Plugin archive downloadable in WinMerge download page.</para>

    <para>If <filename>Merge7z*.dll</filename> file is missing, WinMerge
    informs user with message showing filename of needed file and recommended
    version of 7-Zip. This message can also be opened from
    <guimenu>Help</guimenu>-menu item "<guimenuitem>Archive Support
    Disabled</guimenuitem>".</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Merge7zInstaller</title>

      <para>This is a stand-alone installer for 7-Zip integration.</para>

      <para>Installer filenames may seem weird at first, but there is reason
      for them: they show supported versions. Filename is formatted
      <filename>Merge7zInstallerXXX-YYY-ZZZ.exe</filename>. XXX is build
      number, YYY earliest 7-Zip version supported and ZZZ latest 7-Zip
      version supported. For example
      <filename>Merge7zInstaller0014-311-426.exe</filename> means build
      version 14, and support for 7-Zip versions 3.11 - 4.26.</para>

      <para>This separate installer is much more flexible since we can update
      it whenever 7-Zip is updated. And we don't add files users don't need to
      base installer.</para>

      <para>The latest version is always available directly in our downloads
      at SourceForge.net: <ulink
      url="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13216&amp;package_id=143957"
      userlevel="">7-Zip plugin</ulink> and of course from our homepage at
      <ulink url="http://www.winmerge.org/">WinMerge.org</ulink>.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>If you want to know immediately when we release new versions,
        you can Monitor our releases. When monitoring release, you get sent
        e-mail notifications about new releases when they happen.</para>

                multiple WinMerge installations and other programs using 7-zip
                plugin. This is recommended installation.</simpara>

              <listitem>
                <simpara><guilabel>Application specific

                directory. Files are then usable only by that
                program.</simpara>

                <para>This selection requires user to select executable in
                directory where plugin files are installed. Select WinMerge
                executable file when installing to WinMerge directory.</para>

                installs also required 7-Zip files to program's (application
                specific installation) directory. This allows minimal usable
                installation of 7-Zip for archive support. This can be used
                when 7-Zip application is not wanted or needed.</simpara>

                <para>This installation type does contain only needed files
                for WinMerge (or other application) to enable archive support.
                It does not install 7-Zip user interface or other related
                tools or files. After this install it is not possible to open
                or create 7-Zip archive files outside WinMerge.</para>
