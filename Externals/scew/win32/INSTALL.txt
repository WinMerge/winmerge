Windows Installation
====================

Note: Since SCEW 1.0.0, Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 (Express Edition)
has been used to provide Windows support.

   Extract the SCEW distribution library to your desired location. For
example, the scew-1.0.0 distribution may be extracted to:

   c:\lib\scew-1.0.0

   Open the 'scew.sln' (Microsoft Visual Studio Solution) or
'scew.vcproj' (Visual C++ Project) files. Go to the 'Build' menu and
choose 'Batch Build...'. Select all the desired configurations (see
README.txt) to be built and click 'Rebuild'. This will build all
selected libraries in:

   c:\lib\scew-1.0.0\win32\lib

   In every new application you will need to add an additional
'Include' directory, so the compiler can find the SCEW headers and an
additional 'Library' directory so the linker can find the correct SCEW
library and build your application successfully.

   Include directory
      SCEW top level, e.g. "c:\lib\scew-1.0.0"

   Library directory
      SCEW win32 lib, e.g. "c:\lib\scew-1.0.0\win32\lib"

You will also have to do the same for Expat:

   Include directory
      <expat_install>\source\lib e.g. "c:\lib\expat\source\lib"

   Library directory
      <expat_install>\bin e.g. "c:\lib\expat\bin"


For more information about how to link SCEW as a static or shared
library with your application read the README.txt.
