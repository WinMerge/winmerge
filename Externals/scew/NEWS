* Version 0.4.0 (25/05/04)

** Changes:

        - Ability  to load  and XML  document  from an  stream has  been
          added. The stream  may not be completed, so  it will just load
          correct  XML pieces.   A callback,  set by  the user,  will be
          called each time an element is available.
          (thanks to Gord Shier)

** Fixes:

        - Fixed  indentation  level   when  document  contains  multiple
          consecutive empty elements.
          (thanks to Tom Probasco)

        - scew_element_add_attr_pair()  did  not  add  a  new  attribute
          correctly if the attribute already existed.
          (reported by Matthew Peltzer)

        - Compiltaion  fixes in MSVC.   Compiler interpreted  a function
          argument called list as the std::list.
