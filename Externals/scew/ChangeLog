	* src/xtree.*: added XML preamble support.

2003-12-09  Brodie Thiesfield

        * re-jigged the source tree to make building and installing as a
        common system library on Windows easier.

        * src directory renamed scew to keep consistency of code on
        both Unix and Windows platforms. Enables cross platform building
        of code always using #include <scew/scew.h>

        * added Windows DevStudio 6+ build workspace to easily build
        all required versions of the library.

        * much of scew/str.* rewritten to use compiler macros instead of
        separate functions. Means one less level of function calling and
        supports Unicode building on Windows simply.

        * scew/mem.* removed (functions now available through str.h)

        * added INSTALL.WIN32 file to describe building on Windows
