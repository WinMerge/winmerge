WinMerge version numbers are managed by the versions.ini file and
Tools/Scripts/SetVersions.py script. When the script is run it sets version
numbers for all resources listed in the ini file.

SetVersions.py script usage:

!!! This script is work in progress !!!

The SetVersions.py script sets versions numbers in different components.
Components and version numbers to set are defined in configuration file. The
configuration file is Windows INI-file kind of file, with sections and values.

The section name is only descriptive for the resource to process. It gets
printed by the script when running.

All sections have these values:
- type
  Resource type to set
- description
  Short description of the resource (e.g. Installer) to set version
- path
  Relative path to the resource to process
- version
  Version string/number to set

Available types are:
CS-AssemblyInfo:
  Set version number to C# AssemblyInfo file. The script searches for line
  having assembly: AssemblyVersion -text and sets the version number.

InnoSetup:
  Set version number to InnoSetup installer script. The installer script
  must have preprocessor define for the version number. The script replaces
  value of this macro.

  [Installer]
  type = InnoSetup
  description = WinMerge InnoSetup installer
  path = Installer/InnoSetup/WinMerge.iss
  macro = AppVersion
  version = "2.9.12"

NSIS: 
  Set version number to NSIS installer script. The installer script must have
  version defined with PRODUCT_VERSION -macro. For example:
  !define PRODUCT_VERSION "1.2.3"

  For example:
  [Installer]
  type = NSIS
  description = ChecksumTool NSIS Installer
  path = Installer/NSIS/CheckSumTool.nsi
  version = "0.6.0"

WinRC:
  Set file- and product-version into the Windows RC file. The script searches
  for version numbers in version resource. The script also makes sure that
  numeric version number has always four numbers. If less numbers are given,
  zeros are added to the end.

C-Define:
  Set version numbers to C/C++ file which has #define lines with macros for
  each part of the version number. Version number is given as one number. Macro
  names for each part must be present, but can be empty.

  [Executable]
  type = C-Define
  description = Frhed executable
  path = Frhed/version.h
  version = "1.3.6.2"
  define-major = FRHED_MAJOR_VERSION
  define-minor = FRHED_MINOR_VERSION
  define-subrelease = FRHED_SUB_RELEASE_NO
  define-buildnumber = FRHED_BUILD_NO
