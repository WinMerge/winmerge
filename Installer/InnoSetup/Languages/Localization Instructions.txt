The .ISL or Inno Setup Language files files are in .ini format, wich means you have a line that looks like this to translate:
SomeLabelName=I'm a label's text translate me

If a particular line doesn't already contain a period in it please don't add one, that means Inno Setup will add a period automatically.  If you add a period to that line, then there will be two of them.  

The other type of text you should never modify are variables and they come in two forms:
%1, %2, %3, etc...

or

[name], [mb], [name/ver], etc... 

The remainder of this file contains specific instructions for each localized language.  Please look for your langauge within this file.  If it's not listed then please let me know. 

The following languages do not need translating:
Czech, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, and Slovenian
