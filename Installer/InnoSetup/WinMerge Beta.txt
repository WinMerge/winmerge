-A Task item was added to or not to Install Tortoise CVS Support
-TortoiseCVS registry settings are no longer installed unless the user requests them
-Plugins are now installed
-Installer no longer tries to delete locked ShellExtension.dll file since it's locked (speeds up installation)
-CompareTimeStamp flags were removed from all files since it occurs automatically on files lacking version info
-PSAPI.dll is now bundled with the installer since it's required by the Setup Helper.exe (AutoIt 3.X Application) under Windows NT 4.0
-ATL.DLL is now bundled for ShellExtension.dll
-Fixed the output file name to match our teams naming conventions
-The installer's built in 7-Zip Compression is kicking ass we're bundling 3.26MB of Runtimes alone and our installer still winds up being only 2.5MB!
-A Setup Helper.exe program was added to update the ShellExtension without requiring a reboot (Explorer.exe is restarted).  Note poorly written tray icon applications will disapear, and this is not our bug or fault.  
-The localization plugin RCLLocalization.DLL is no longer included with the installer
-A language selection dialog appears at the start of the installation supporting 12/17 of our application's languages
-Once the user has selected a language for the installer to display in, they won't have to choose to install that language's Merge[Language].lang file, it'll happen automatically.
